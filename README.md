    Bear Cub Theme for Logseq

The Bear Cub theme is minimalistic and functional.  This theme doesn't distract you with an explosion of color and graphical elements. Instead, it helps you stay focused. It creates a clear distinction between different structural and functional elements, which helps you see a bigger picture at a glance at any time.

## Screenshots
### Dark Theme

Please note: built-in bullet threading, unobtrusive page and block properties, clearly noticeable collapsed blocks, easily distinguishable block links, block embeds and tags.

Please note: Todo items are clearly discernible, but done items fade out of attention. Syntax highlighting in the code block is not part of this theme. It is configured through [CodeMirror themes](https://codemirror.net/5/demo/theme.html). More on this [here](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/3699).

Please note: page and block properties take up less room on the screen and stay unobtrusive until you bring your attention to them and start interacting with them.
